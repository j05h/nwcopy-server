          So, I have two laptops at my desk. Unfortunately, one of them is on a VPN, and I'll be damned if I can't get them to talk to one another when that is happening. Even when they aren't it is incredibly unwieldy to copy and paste links between the machines. And why is this? I dunno. It shouldn't be as much effort as it is. I've found myself using email, <a href="http://getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, whatever. Why can't this be a trivial thing to do?
          </p>
          <p>
          That's when I decided I needed to build a better solution. Well, at least for me. This site is me sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
          My first attempt, which is actually pretty useful was a ruby gem (<a href="https://github.com/j05h/nwcopy">nwcopy</a>). It works wonderfully. It integrates with pbcopy and pbpaste; it uses dropbox; it uses gist; it has plugins. All in all, its pretty sexy. However, I wanted more. I don't always have Dropbox available. And gist only solves the text file problem. What about binaries.
          <p>
          Something had to be done!
          </p>
          <p>This website is that something. I've got a super simple protocol. One URL for copy, one URL for paste. You sign in via github for credentials, and we'll take care of the rest. Tell me your hopes and your dreams and I'll see what I can do about implementing them.
